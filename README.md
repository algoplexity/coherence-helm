## 🔭 Vision
This repository contains the hardware schematics, firmware, and theoretical frameworks for the **Cybernetic Helm**—a tangible interface designed to translate abstract Algorithmic Information Dynamics (AID) into haptic physical sensation.

## 🧠 The Problem
Traditional risk models are purely visual and statistical. They fail to convey the **visceral difference** between two fundamental modes of systemic failure:
1.  **Internal Cognitive Collapse (UAI Limit / Rule 54):** Where the system "thinks" too hard and locks up.
2.  **External Thermodynamic Shock (QCEA Limit / Rule 60):** Where the landscape moves faster than the system.

## 🛠 The Artifact
We are building a force-feedback control surface that allows a human operator to **feel** these states:
*   **Rule 54** creates **Resistance** (High Torque/Stiffness) $\to$ Intervention: *Simplify Connections*.
*   **Rule 60** creates **Vibration** (Loss of Friction/Chaos) $\to$ Intervention: *Increase Bandwidth*.

## 📂 Contents
*   `/hardware`: CAD files and wiring diagrams for the Force-Feedback Motor (ESP32/Arduino).
*   `/firmware`: Code translating the "AIT Physicist" Python output into haptic signals.
*   `/theory`: The Whitepaper: *"The Cybernetic Helm: Steering Through the Dancing Landscape."*
